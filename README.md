### Data Visualization/Analysis

The clean data was loaded from the power query editor into the fields pane of Power BI itself. Afterwards, some calculations were carried out using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in order to create some measures.

Some of the measures created were: Mortality Rate, Recovery Rate and Total Measure. 

The Covid-19 Dashboard includes the following components:

- KPI Metrics: Presents key performance indicator metrics such as confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, death count, recovery rate, and death rate.

- Country-wise Cases: Displays the number of confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths for each country.

- Geographic Map Visual: Visualizes the number of confirmed cases by geographical location on a world map, allowing for a geographical understanding of the spread.
